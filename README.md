Program(s) to calculate stellar inclinations.

To use this code, try:

<code>git clone https://github.com/kenny-phan/stellar-inclinations.git</code>

This codebase pulls from the NASA Exoplanet Archive's TAP Service, the [SpinSpotter](https://github.com/rae-holcomb/SpinSpotter) codebase, and ideally will implement [ARIADNE](https://github.com/jvines/astroARIADNE) and [PySME](https://github.com/MingjieJian/SME) in the near future.
