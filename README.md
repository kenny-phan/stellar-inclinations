This codebase pulls from the NASA Exoplanet Archive's TAP Service, the [SpinSpotter](https://github.com/rae-holcomb/SpinSpotter) codebase, [ARIADNE](https://github.com/jvines/astroARIADNE) and hopefully a combination of [PySME](https://github.com/MingjieJian/SME) and [PypeIt](https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt) in the near future.
