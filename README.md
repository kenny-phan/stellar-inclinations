# stellar-inclinations
Program(s) to calculate stellar inclinations.

To use this code, try:

<code>git clone https://github.com/kenny-phan/stellar-inclinations.git</code>

This codebase pulls from the NASA Exoplanet Archive's TAP Service, the SpinSpotter codebase, and ideally will implement ARIADNE and PySME in the near future.
